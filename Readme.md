# Free Open Scientific Equipment

Fermium LTD announces the free release of all scientific equipment designs under the terms of the MIT license. You are free to use them as you wish.

## Why?

Our small business is no longer competitive in this sector, and thus we've ceased production of this scientific equipment.

## What's Included

# ltk-mw-electronics

A 10Ghz microwave transmitter and receiver for the Fermium LTD Microwave Optics Kit.

It uses a [New Japan Radio NJR4178](https://www.mouser.co.uk/ProductDetail/Nisshinbo/NJR4178?qs=d9U39LAeJF0rFkagUuXIpQ%3D%3D) doppler radar or alternatively a cheap 10Ghz radar of the same footprint that can be found on Aliexpress.
